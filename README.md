# MLProcessMap

A website to explore the Process Reference Model (PRM) for Machine Learning from the doctoral thesis. Anyone can browse it without signing in, and admins edit the model from `/admin` with their GitHub account.

- **Process map** of each PRM version, coloured by origin, with full-text search.
- **Process pages** with purpose, outcomes, inputs, outputs, activities, the sources of each activity, traceability to the ISO/IEC standards and the workshop annotations that changed it.
- **Work products**: which process produces each input and which processes use each output.
- **Compare versions**: word-level diff of every process between two versions.
- **Lifecycle templates** that arrange the processes of a version into phases and iterations, and serve as starting points for the lifecycle builder.
- **Lifecycle builder**: create a custom lifecycle model for a project: choose the processes and activities, arrange them into phases with repetitions and feedback loops, preview its diagram, see inputs left without a producer, and export it as a Markdown checklist, CSV, JSON or a lifecycle template file (YAML). The model lives in the link, and the JSON, YAML and CSV exports can be imported to share it as a file.

## How to cite

If you use the PRM, cite the thesis:

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requires Node 22.12 or newer.

## Content

All content is YAML under `content/`. The site is generated from it; nothing else holds model data.

```
content/
  site.yaml                         title and introduction, per language
  versions.yaml                     PRM versions, the default one, and the process map layout
  studies.yaml                      primary studies of the SLR (P1–P18)
  references.yaml                   bibliography used by the activities
  prm/<version>/
    processes/<lang>/P01.yaml …     one file per process and language
    work-products.yaml              type of each work product (information item, artifact, record)
  lifecycles/<lang>/<id>.yaml       lifecycle templates
  ui/<lang>.yaml                    interface text (menus, buttons, page texts)
```

Text fields accept `*emphasis*` and `**bold**`.

The build checks the content and stops with a message naming the file when something is inconsistent: a file that is not valid YAML or misses a field, a file in a place the site does not read, an input that serves an outcome letter that does not exist, an activity that cites an unknown study or reference, a lifecycle that lists a process missing from its PRM version, a translation whose outcomes, activities, inputs or outputs differ from the English file, or interface text that does not match `content/ui/en.yaml`. To list every problem without building the site:

```sh
npm run check:content
```

The shape of each file is in `src/lib/content/schemas.ts`; the other checks are rules in `src/lib/validation/rules/`, each with a test in `src/lib/validation/validation.test.ts` (`npm test`).

### Translations

The English files are the reference. To translate a process, copy `content/prm/v2/processes/en/P09.yaml` to `content/prm/v2/processes/es/P09.yaml` and translate the text, keeping the IDs, outcome letters, work product IDs and sources. Untranslated processes are shown in English with a notice. The admin panel shows the languages side by side and copies the fields that are not translated.

Interface text is in `content/ui/<lang>.yaml`, grouped by section, and can be translated from the admin panel under **Interface text**. `en.yaml` is the reference: a string missing in another language is shown in English, and the build fails if a translation has a key that English does not or changes a placeholder such as `{n}`. To add a string, add it to `en.yaml` and use it in the code as `t('section.key')`.

### New PRM version

```sh
npm run new-version -- v3              # copy of the default version
npm run new-version -- v3 --from v1
```

This copies the process files, drops the workshop annotations (they belong to the version they produced), and adds the version to `versions.yaml` as a draft. Edit it from the admin panel, then set its status to `current` and make it the default.

## Publishing on GitHub Pages

1. Push the repository to GitHub with `main` as the default branch.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. In **Settings → Environments → github-pages → Deployment branches and tags**, allow `main` and `thesis`.
4. Every push to `main` or `thesis` builds and deploys the site; pull requests are built to check them.

## Live and thesis editions

The site is published in two editions from this repository:

| Edition | Branch | Address | Admin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live: the tool as it keeps evolving | `main` | `/` | `/admin/` |
| Thesis: the version described in the doctoral thesis | `thesis` | `/thesis/` | `/thesis/admin/` |

The thesis edition receives corrections and translations but no new features. It shows a banner that links to the live edition, and search engines do not index it; the live edition links to it from the footer. GitHub Pages publishes one site per repository, so the deploy workflow builds both branches on every push to either of them; keep `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` the same on both. The edition of a build is set by `PUBLIC_EDITION` (`live` or `thesis`, see `src/lib/edition.ts`); a local build is the live edition.

**Fixes and translations go to `thesis` first**, through `/thesis/admin/` or a commit on the branch, and are then carried to the live edition by merging:

```sh
git switch main
git merge thesis
```

Git only stops for a conflict where `main` has changed the same lines since, which is resolved once. Never merge `main` into `thesis`.

## Admin access

The admin panel at `/admin` is [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms). Edits are saved as commits to the repository, which redeploys the site, so the history of every change to the PRM is in git.

Only people with write access to the repository can save changes. Add admins as collaborators in **Settings → Collaborators**.

Admins can sign in in two ways:

- **Access token** (no setup): create a [fine-grained personal access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) for this repository with *Contents: Read and write*, and paste it in **Sign In Using Access Token**.
- **Sign in with GitHub**: deploy [sveltia-cms-auth](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms-auth) to Cloudflare Workers (free) and set its URL as the repository variable `CMS_AUTH_URL` in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**.
